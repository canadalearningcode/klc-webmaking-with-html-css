        #Using Mozilla Thimble

        Thimble is a free, online text editing tool for creating webpages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but we’re focusing on the first two. Thimble provides a ton of starter projects to remix, or the ability to start a project from scratch. Everything created in Thimble can be published online for others to see, without worrying about domains or hosting fees. Here are a few resources to get you started:

        * Mozilla Thimble <a href="https://thimble.mozilla.org/en-US/">Website</a>
        * Troubleshooting: <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thimble/FAQ">Thimble FAQ</a>
        * HTML <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp">Reference</a>
        * CSS <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp">Reference</a>

        #Introduction

        ##Kick-Off Script

        Welcome to our Kids Learning Code workshop: Webmaking with HTML & CSS! We’re so glad that you could be here today and hope you’re ready to learn lots of new things.

        How many of you have been to one of our workshops or camps before?
        (If you get some hands up, ask a few of them what workshops they attended)

        We started running our first programs for kids with Girls Learning Code workshops and camps back in 2012, and then since we had so many people asking if boys could come too we started Kids Learning Code a year later in 2013. Since then, we’ve expanded to over 29 cities across Canada and have taught over 19,000 kids how to code!

        Before we get started with our workshop, there are a few things we need to go over:

        * <strong>Washrooms:</strong> Can everyone please point in the direction of the washrooms? (clarify where they are located) If you need to go to the washroom, please bring a buddy with you.
        * <strong>Water:</strong> If you brought a water bottle with you, you’re welcome to keep it on your desk, but make sure to keep the lid closed when you’re not using it. If you don’t have a water bottle, one of our mentors can help grab a glass from the kitchen later on (but please keep glasses away from laptops).
        * <strong>Break/snacks:</strong> We’ll have a 10 minute break when you can eat any snacks you brought with you or just stretch your legs. If you have a (peanut free) snack, please eat it out front and clean up any crumbs or wrappers when you’re done.

        #Code-Along

        * Choose a remixing activity from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ckzccm6FAIiOKTs_OKP64XORKTcDnZHwfFN5cfGBmto/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>. Suggested activity: Remix the News.
        * Read the description and test it out ahead of time, so that it’s familiar.
        * Remind learners: when remixing projects in HTML, it’s important not to accidentally delete tags. Show learners how to edit the text within the tags to start. Deleting and replacing tags is fine - as long as it’s intentional!
        * Go through the chosen activity. While remixing your example up front, be sure to point out IMAGE tags and LINK tags. These are formatted a bit differently, so it’s helpful to play around with the different elements within these.
        * Click ‘Publish’ to save remixed projects. Webmaker projects require a username and password to publish. Learners can login with <strong>girlslearncode / helloworld123 (GLC) or kidslearningcode / Helloworld123 (KLC).</strong>

        #Work Session

        * Time to build our websites! Brainstorm some ideas for websites as inspiration (see slide #24 for examples).
        * Open up a new project in <a href="http://thimble.mozilla.org">Mozilla Thimble</a>, and take a look at the tags already provided. Go through them again as a refresher. (The ```<meta>``` tags can be distracting, so it might be helpful to point out that they are in the HEAD because they hold information for the browser that we don’t need everyone else to see.)
        * Go through STEPS 1-3 (slides #26-28) to get learners started.
        * Use the Add-On’s as needed (slides #29,30).
        * Give learners time to add some more text and images to their websites (slide #31).

        Provide printed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jVa14X__A63sA6XsDhzXqRwbZszartYkQ_ARM8TedtU/edit?usp=sharing">STEPS sheets</a> at the front for learners to bring to their seat, as needed.  Go through the steps together, but inform the group that they can borrow a sheet for any of the steps if they are ahead or behind the group, so they can work at their own pace. Remind them to return the sheet to the front when they grab the next one.

        #Work Session

        * Time to style our websites! Have the style.css page open in Thimble, and the <a href="http://css.cool">css.cool</a> website open in another tab.
        * Show learners how to click on elements in css.cool to copy to their clipboard, then paste in Thimble (remind them of ctrl+V shortcut).
        * Go through STEPS 1-3 (slides #43-45) to get learners started, referring back to css.cool for additional inspiration.
        * Use the Add-On’s as needed (slides #46-48).
        * Remind learners that they can borrow the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jVa14X__A63sA6XsDhzXqRwbZszartYkQ_ARM8TedtU/edit?usp=sharing">STEPS sheets</a> from the front to track along at their own pace.
        * Give learners time to continue styling and working on their websites until the end of the workshop.
        * Save the last 5-10 minutes for demos. Ask for a few volunteer learners to share their website up front. Optionally, open up the websites in preview mode on all of the computers and have a ‘gallery walk’ style presentation, so all learners can participate.


        <br>
        #Unplugged Activity (Optional)

        If you notice that the group is needing a break, give them 10 minutes to use the washroom, get some water, or grab a snack from their bags. Another option is to run an unplugged activity midway through the workshop to get them out of their seats and moving around. Unplugged activities usually take around 10 minutes to run. Choose an unplugged activity from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tUTiHl7scs8RHdLLvdmZTFtD9EuAyZhetTLFgvar5CQ/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>. Suggested activity: Do The Robot.

        #Closing Script

        Who can tell me something new they learned today? (<strong>*Refer to slide 50 for examples</strong>. If you don’t get any hands up, you can either ask a specific kid that was definitely engaged during the workshop, or review a couple of the key lessons in the workshop)

        You all did an amazing job and we’re really impressed with how great your projects turned out.

        If you want to learn more about coding, design, and technology, go onto our site kidslearningcode.com to check out all of our upcoming workshops and join our mailing list. (Announce next workshop and give short description).

        Before we go, let’s give our mentors a big hand!

        Thanks and we hope to see you all in another workshop soon!
